**v0.1.0 (draft)**

# Introduction

In any high-functioning team, honesty beats optimism. Clarity moves faster than guesswork. And accountability is more productive than posturing.

**The No Bullshit Policy** is a framework for how we communicate, give feedback, and own our work. It’s not about being harsh or toxic — it’s about being real. No pretending things are fine when they’re not. No vague updates. No fake alignment. Just grounded, respectful, direct communication that helps us ship great work together.

This isn’t a set of rules. It’s a shared commitment to candor, trust, and momentum.

# The No Bullshit Specification

## 1. Don’t bullshit others

- **Deliver bad news early**  
  Waiting never helps. Bringing up problems quickly allows the team — especially those facing customers — to respond, adjust priorities, and collaborate on solutions.  
  Examples:  
  - *“This won’t be ready in time.”*  
  - *“We’re blocked.”*  
  - *“I think we don’t have capacity for this.”*

- **Don’t wait for the next standup to raise issues**  
  Speak up as soon as something goes wrong. Don’t let process delay progress.

- **Communicate progress frequently**  
  Don’t assume silence is fine. Share what’s done, what’s not, and what’s unclear.

- **Don’t lie (even gently)**  
  “It’s almost done” when it’s not helps no one. Accuracy builds trust.

## 2. Don’t bullshit people under you

- **If you lead, give honest feedback**  
  Everyone deserves feedback that’s real, respectful, and actionable.  
  Sugarcoating or avoidance hurts more than it helps.

---

## 3. Don’t bullshit yourself

- **Acknowledge when you don’t understand**  
  Admitting confusion early is a strength. Faking clarity delays everything.

- **Go straight to the hard part**  
  Don’t spend time polishing the easy stuff to avoid facing the hard thing. Prioritize the risk, the unknown, the blocker.

## 4. Be accountable for your actions

- **Own your mistakes**  
  No deflection. Say it plainly.  
  Examples:  
  - *“I didn’t communicate early enough.”*  
  - *“I opened the doc too late and didn’t have access.”*

- **Don’t blame — support**  
  If someone else drops the ball, help them pick it back up. The goal is progress, not guilt.

*This policy is a living document. It will evolve as we learn what works — and what doesn’t.*
