# The No BS Policy v0.2.0

## Core Principles

1. **Direct Communication**: Say what you mean, mean what you say
2. **No Hidden Agendas**: Be transparent about intentions and goals
3. **Action Over Words**: Focus on what you do, not what you say you'll do
4. **Own Your Mistakes**: When you fuck up, admit it and fix it
5. **Respect Time**: Don't waste other people's time with unnecessary meetings or bullshit
6. **Question Everything**: Don't accept "because that's how we've always done it"

## Communication Rules

- No corporate speak or buzzwords
- No passive-aggressive behavior
- No sugar-coating bad news
- No promises you can't keep
- No meetings that could be emails

## Decision Making

- Make decisions based on data, not feelings
- If you don't have data, say so

## Accountability
